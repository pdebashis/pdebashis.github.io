                My mother was once approached by 2 insurance agents from bajaj Finance at our home. She was asked to pre-maturely close all of my fathers FDs and withdraw the deposit amounts into her own account. I let them go ahead with these processes. Then she was asked for options on how to invest this amount. We were not interested for anything other than a FD and since Bajaj Finance had the services, we agreed to park the withdrawn money with them.

                My career has been dynamic over the first few years. I have moved from project to project, within a company or across, up in hierarchy or sideways, creating a matrix of career options for myself. Sometimes the change was fast, at times slow and on some instances even in the wrong direction, but I have now built up a portfolio of experiences.
These are the various hats I have witnessed and a 5yo explanation of what that titles entitles you to do typically.
