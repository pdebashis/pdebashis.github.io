                Purpose is unique to each individual. Professionally, I would like to have an indispensable role wherever I am. But where do i want to be in my personal life?
In five years time, I may want to go to the beach. I dont want an expensive indoor movie theater experience at my house. i can just watch a movie on my laptop or TV. I dont want an expensive bmw and have to wash and maintain it.

                There are sometimes incidents which is a disaster and should&rsquo;ve/could&rsquo;ve been avoided. Rather than the details of the failure itself, what is more interesting is the way it is handled. The team working on it, sometimes takes a tiny system fault to a gigantic catastrophe through a cascading series of events. At other times, the team is able to take a catastrophic system failure and make a commendable save.
I try to avoid the following -

                These are the typical roles I have come across.
programming These people make sure the code matches the design and give feedback into the design process based on their technical knowledge
architecture/design These people figure out the overall technical design that matches the business needs, make tradeoffs between technical purity and practicality (e.g. X sucks but everyone in the company uses X so we have to use it too). This person is required to interface with other teams.

                Weekends are a peaceful way to work with no one standing behind your shoulders. So you can spend appropriate amount of time on a task rather than doing it in a hurry. This leads to better quality of work and I end up enjoying more what of what i do. There is also less emails and chats for distractions.
I relax a lot on weekdays with tea breaks and chit-chats here and there.
