<h1>Why Resign and then come back </h1>

Sep. 26, 2021


<br/><br/>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really appreciate what we have until its gone. I was doing well and I got excited wanting to earn more money and experience new workplaces so I left. I expected any place i go to, to have the same standards and satisfaction of work.</p>
<p>Heck no. I joined a company out in an older part of bangalore that was a marketing analysis/telecom campaigning software company. I thought I was bringing some relevant/current knowledge in to the company that I had learned from other smart engineers I was fortunate to work with in the past.</p>
<p>I was put into Customer support , where nobody ( including managers ) gave any attention to work culture or work life balance. We used to slog hard and extreme burnout was commonplace.</p>
<p>Here is what felt was wrong :</p>
<ul>
<li>No onboarding, I was working on production systems a few days into the company before even being introduced to everyone.</li>
<li>Multiple higher level employees are known to yell at people in meetings. Openly hated by employees.</li>
<li>No culture. People don&rsquo;t talk to each other at all. Everyone is cold and unfriendly.</li>
<li>Mass attrition. The implementation department had lost 2/3rd of existing employees in a year. They responded by doing mass hiring but even those new people were noping out after they found out what a nightmare this place was.</li>
<li>The Senior Engineer was barely responsive despite having all the knowledge probably due to his own work pressure. (he did good work, but did not provide any guidance to me and was super negative)</li>
</ul>
<p>I stayed in that job for 2 years , and left. Start-ups aren&rsquo;t worth it if you&rsquo;re not one of the founders or there from the beginning. The chance of getting a proper pay out that is worth the effort you put in is nearly nil.</p>
<p>I tried a few interviews but it didnâ€™t lead to anything. I was not getting any calls from anywhere I wanted to join. And I was losing patience. So one bad day I called my old manager and asked if there is any opening. His nod was good enough for me to put in the papers at my workplace and start the mandatory 2 month notice period</p>
<p>What followed was a couple of interviews with my old company leaders and within a month, I got an offer letter. It was in one of these interviews that I was asked this question - Why Resign and then come back?</p>
