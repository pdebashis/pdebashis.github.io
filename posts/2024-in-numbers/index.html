<h1>2024 in numbers</h1>

Dec. 31, 2024


<br/><br/>
<p>Around this time of the year, I used to sit down and reflect on the past year and plan the next one. For this, I had an elaborate [booklet] (<a href="https://yearcompass.com">https://yearcompass.com</a>) of about 20 pages, carefully curated with selected questions and exercises. The aim of the activity was to uncover my own patterns from last year and design the ideal next year. Although I stopped it in the interest of time, but the retrospective habit has stuck with me. I came up with my own system. I picked various items of interest and started creating small trackers around them, filling it throughout the year. And here I am - with lots of numbers to reflect on.</p>
<h2 id="where-i-spent-my-time">Where I spent my Time?</h2>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>248 days in Bangalore
104 days in Bhubaneswar
4 days at Yercaud
4 days at Hampi
3 days at Patna
2 days at Kabini
1 day at Puri
</code></pre><p>The number of days spent at Bangalore is lower than does not justify the high rent, but the number of days at Bhubaneswar makes me happy and something I would like to maintain in coming years. Before the pandemic, spending even 10 days at Bhubaneswar or any less than 300 days at Bangalore was unthinkable. Now, I could go back home every once in a while. The company I was working for had a hybrid work culture that allowed me this freedom.</p>
<h3 id="how-many-chess-games-did-i-play">How many chess games did I play</h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>1241 Blitz games
313 bullet games
132 rapid games 
18 chess960 games 
2 daily games 
</code></pre><p>For the most part of the year, I avoided playing rapid games with the fear of losing my 1700 rating. The above stats are only from chess.com games pulled using a script. <a href="/posts/chess-analytics.md">Read more about this topic</a>. Apart from these, I played a few games on lichess and over the board with friends and collegues. I didnt attend any major chess events this year which will be my plan of action for next year.</p>
<h2 id="where-i-spent-my-money">Where I spent my Money?</h2>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>₹ 193,517 for capital assets
₹ 27,903 for annual costs
₹ 5193 for game purchases
₹ 74,427 for clothing
₹ 113,912 for travelling
</code></pre><p>The capital assets category is for purchases which are generally household and cost more than 2k, and are for a longer time period. This includes some furniture items and a bike this year. These are fewer big purchases comparatively. However, I had my wedding this year, which explains the abnormally high clothing expense. The amount spent travelling seems adequate given there weren&rsquo;t any abroad trips. The amount spent visiting home is not included in travelling.</p>
