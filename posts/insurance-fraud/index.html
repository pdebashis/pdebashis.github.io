<h1>Insurance Fraud</h1>

Oct. 1, 2022


<br/><br/>
<p>After my fathers death, who had multiple accounts with Bajaj finserv, my mother was approached by 2 agents at our home. She was asked to pre-maturely close all of my fathers FDs and withdraw the deposit amounts into her own account. I let them go ahead with these processes. Then she was asked for options on how to invest this amount. We were not interested for anything other than a FD and since Bajaj Finance had the same services, we agreed to park the withdrawn money with them. While creating this FD, we were suggested to go for a smaller amount first. The money was transferred.</p>
<p>A few days later, I received a letter which claimed that an insurance policy had been purchased on my mothers name using the money we transferred for an FD. This came as a shock to me and alarm bells started going off in my head. We were scammed.</p>
<p>I had clearly transferred money expecting it to be an FD. I had to immediately talk to the agents and could tell from their response that it was not a mistake but intentionally done by them. Since then I have been looking for options on closure of the insurance policy and all other accounts currently open in my father and mothers name with Bajaj Allianz/Finserv etc. The agents listen to me and make me write bogus applications which obviously do not go anywhere. Post 30 days, the policy could no longer be closed and now we are stuck with yearly payments for 4 years and the money will not be seen for 10 years.</p>
<p>This as I understand now, is a case of insurance mis-selling. The agents at the local office here must have been enjoying their fat commissions and awards for achieving their insurance targets while I have been running from office to office, agent to agent to get it resolved.</p>
<h1 id="meanwhile-at-the-bajaj-finance-office-fictional">Meanwhile at the Bajaj Finance Office (Fictional)</h1>
<p>Random Agent 1 - Listen to this, Sasmita has just managed to close an insurance deal with a premium of rupees four lakhs. But the matter of the fact is that she was able to sell an insurance scheme to a 54 year old lady passing it off as a fixed deposit product. What makes it more special is also the fact that this customer has never invested in anything but a fixed deposit till now.</p>
<p>Random Agent 2 - Its almost the end of this term, she must have earned a fat commission to close this deal. Was the customer really that dumb to fall for this?</p>
<p>Random Agent 1 - Well, thats the neat part. She was never a customer before. It was her late husband. Sasmita was able to pull this off during the death claim settlements. Both the lady and her son were clueless. They didn’t ask too many questions and just agreed to whatever Sasmita told her.</p>
<p>Random Agent 2 - But is this ethical?</p>
<p>Random Agent 1 - This is normal stuff, happens all the time. Every branch in the country does this. To meet their insurance targets.</p>
<p>Random Agent 2 - Cool, Learn something new everyday.</p>

<p>This tale brings forth the changing aspirations of urban india, and the saga of greed which prevails in most corporates in India, morally bankrupt executives are willing to go to any extent to fulfill their own selfish desires.</p>
