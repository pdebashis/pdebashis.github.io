<h1>Designed to Fail?</h1>

Jun. 12, 2021


<br/><br/>
<p>There are sometimes incidents which is a disaster and should&rsquo;ve/could&rsquo;ve been avoided. Rather than the details of the failure itself, what is more interesting is the way it is handled. The team working on it, sometimes takes a tiny system fault to a gigantic catastrophe through a cascading series of events. At other times, the team is able to take a catastrophic system failure and make a commendable save.</p>
<p>I try to avoid the following -</p>
<ol>
<li>Heroics.</li>
</ol>
<p>We should avoid hero narratives in software. We should avoid working all night and on the weekends and making sure everybody in the company knows we did it. We should avoid building silos of expertise where we are the only ones that know what&rsquo;s going on. We should work together to find solution to hard problems. We should celebrate our successes as a team not as individuals. And more importantly, we should learn from failures as a team instead of seeking to scapegoat individuals.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Everyone has a voice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Itâ€™s a pattern, unfortunately, of software teams, that there are 1 or 2 senior engineers that exert a dominant voice in an organization. They insist that their voice is heard over anyone else&rsquo;s. When you allow this in your team, what it eventually does is, it shuts down other people and it keeps them from contributing. The smaller the organization, the prominent is this practice.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Short and specific Mail.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, discussions are dragged over a long a mail chain without conclusion. Every time, new members keep getting looped into the mail chain without a concrete objective in sight. I often see mail chains above 2MB in size before I get looped in. And it is not only a pain to go through the history of mails but also, multiple objectives are being handled in the same mail leading to high levels of confusion.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Conventions and Documenting</li>
</ol>
