      <description>A Hadoop ecosystem is a network of computers pooling its resources to solve larger problems. The ecosystem mainly consists of a filesystem and multiple individual components which sits atop the filesystem. Such an ecosystem definitely requires vigorous monitoring to identify any abnormality and prevent major downtimes. Major Hadoop service providers, provide their own tools for monitoring. But for a standalone hadoop, the monitoring aspect is an open field, and you can use your own tools and software.</description>

      <description>These are the different shoes to fill in a project as per my understanding.
programming These people make sure the code matches the design and give feedback into the design process based on their technical knowledge
Implementation These people understand the scope of the product and shape it to meet the client needs. This person is required to interface a lot with other teams and the clients.
Operations These guys handle the production environment and manage all day to day activities involved in running the software in live.</description>

      <description>Testing Hugo Framework to setup a blog
Why blog? A lot of time is spent on technical work and their is no other outlet to put it out here on the internet.
Why Hugo? After working on rails for some time, I found the static generated sites (like Hugo) make more sense than having a full backend for a personal portfolio site. I do not have any dynamic content requirements and it was also easier to host.</description>
