      <description>My mother was once approached by 2 insurance agents from bajaj Finance at our home. She was asked to pre-maturely close all of my fathers FDs and withdraw the deposit amounts into her own account. I let them go ahead with these processes. Then she was asked for options on how to invest this amount. We were not interested for anything other than a FD and since Bajaj Finance had the services, we agreed to park the withdrawn money with them.</description>

      <description>So, I had been trying to run a simple websocket listener. I had a system in place which will do the authentication and provide me with a wss:// address on which I can add a listener. There are a bunch of libraries to do this. So I copy pasted some code from internet which used the ruby gems faye/websocket and EventMachine and all was good for a while. Till I decided to run this thing on a windows machine.</description>

      <description>How the tech titans and their thinking machines could wrap humanity
Notable Qoutes This is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a whimper. - T.S.Eliot
The first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.
By not using any human data, Zero&amp;rsquo;s creators removed the constraints of human knowledge. Humans, as it turned out, would have held the system back. (in reference to the Alpha Zero)</description>

      <description>Back in the day while starting with programming, there was little exposure to real world applications. All the operating system and compiler design courses seemed highly theoretical and out of reach. But the language courses were a breeze. C, C++ and Java. So what to do with this language knowledge when there are no real world applications of value such as creating an automated bot to interface with telegram API and send a cat picture everyday.</description>

      <description>We don&amp;rsquo;t really appreciate what we have until its gone. I was having a good time in my first company and I expected any place i go to, to have the same standards and satisfaction of work.
Reality had something else to say. I joined a company out in an older part of bangalore that was a marketing analysis/telecom campaigning company. I was put into Customer support, where nobody gave any attention to work culture or work life balance.</description>

      <description>A Hadoop ecosystem requires vigorous monitoring to identify any abnormality and prevent major downtimes. Major Hadoop service providers, provide their own tools for monitoring. But for a standalone hadoop, the monitoring aspect is an open field, and you can use your own tools and scripts to setup a monitoring framework.
Here, lets try to setup a basic script based monitoring capability with essential indicators
Uptime Monitoring Identify each process type running on each cluster.</description>

      <description>These are the various hats one can wear, (that I have come across) at a typical software company.
programming These people make sure the code matches the ideas and designs
technical Lead These are the programmers who now also have a bunch of programmers to guide
operations These people handle the production environment and manage all day to day activities involved in running the software in live.
devops These people make the job of developers easier and systematic by introducing software to automate the various programming, release and deployment related processes</description>
