<h1>A Deep Dive into my chess.com games</h1>

Apr. 9, 2024


<br/><br/>
<p>Since I created an account on chess.com in 2020, I have played an unhealthy amount of games on the website and all my games are saved in their database. The trail of data I have created over the years should contain huge secrets of my own gameplay, but the stats I see on my profile are too basic and do not offer useful plans to improve. If I could to decipher more from the data of my games, I could get potential insights into my strengths and weaknesses. This could help me reach new heights in my own gameplay as I seem to have reached a plateau. This was an opportunity to use my workplace analytics knowledge, in something from my personal life.</p>
<p>Firstly, I am a ruby enthusiast. So, I will use Ruby despite it not being the most suited for the job.</p>
<p>Chess.com provides a free API to read their data. I wanted to do what the analysts do, so I used a jupyter notebook (and installed ruby in it). The closest thing to pandas for python was Daru gem for ruby. Once both of these were setup in a Jupyter Notebook all I had to do next, is invoke a Net::http method to read the games data into a dataframe.</p>
<p>While reading the data, I figured that there is a lot of data and I need to decide which information looks useful for processing. I arrived at the below list of data points.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;date_time&rdquo;,&ldquo;game_type&rdquo;,&ldquo;my_color&rdquo;,&ldquo;opponent_id&rdquo;,&ldquo;my_elo&rdquo;,&ldquo;opponent_elo&rdquo;,&ldquo;result&rdquo;,&ldquo;result_type&rdquo;,&ldquo;game_url&rdquo;,&ldquo;pgn&rdquo;]</p>
<p>The data captured the elo ratings of each player at the time of the game, so I had to add the current ratings for myself and my opponent to see how both have progressed since that game. I also added a few columns by splitting the pgn of the game and creating dedicated columns for the first few moves. The aforementioned columns were added.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;opponent_curr_elo&rdquo;,&ldquo;my_curr_elo&rdquo;,&ldquo;moves_3&rdquo;,&ldquo;moves_4&rdquo;,&ldquo;moves_5&rdquo;,&ldquo;moves_6&rdquo;,&ldquo;moves_9&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Now that I had all the data, it was time to produce insights. The first set of values I prepared, represent the basics stats from a given time period (2023)</p>
<pre><code>Category 	Number of Games 	Wins 	Loss 	Draw 	Start Elo 	Net Wins
bullet 	1638 	813 	796 	29 	1275 	+17

daily 	5 	5 	0 	0 	1380 	+5
blitz_chess960 	2 	1 	1 	0 	1293 	0
</code></pre>
<p>I am interested in looking at games I played as a rematch.</p>

<p>I would like to classify a game as interesting if my opponent has gone on to much higher ratings after losing to me.</p>

<p>I would also classify a game as interesting if my opponent has gone on to much lower ratings after defeating me.</p>

<p>Now, I want to look at my opening moves in each side. So, first of all pulling the number of games for each color.</p>
<pre><code>	games
BLACK 	1716
WHITE 	1727
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like a healthy amount of data. Now, I can check my most frequented opening lines from each side.</p>
<p>As White</p>
<pre><code>moves_3 		total 	WIN 	LOSE 	DRAW
e4 e5 Nf3 Nc6 Bc4 	368 	190 	169 	9
e4 c6 Nf3 d5 Nc3 	254 	132 	118 	4
e4 c5 Nf3 Nc6 Bc4 	115 	64 	49 	2
e4 e6 Nf3 d5 Nc3 	98 	54 	42 	2
e4 c5 Nf3 d6 Bc4 	95 	46 	45 	4
</code></pre>
<p>As Black</p>
<pre><code>moves_3 		total 	WIN 	LOSE 	DRAW
e4 d6 d4 Nf6 Nc3 	336 	177 	144 	15
e4 d6 Nf3 Nf6 Nc3 	186 	98 	85 	3
e4 d6 d4 Nf6 Bd3 	97 	48 	43 	6
d4 Nf6 c4 e6 Nc3 	68 	24 	42 	2
d4 d6 c4 Nf6 Nc3 	63 	35 	27 	1
</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, I wanted to check my performance in each opening.</p>
<pre><code>Caro : +130-118=4 [12]
Stafford : +14-12=0 [2]
Scandinavian : +18-10=1 [8]
Sicilian : +184-182=8 [2]
Italian : +188-169=9 [19]
Pirc : +264-225=24 [39]
Indian Game : +29-21=1 [8]
Nimzo-Indian Game : +34-57=2 [-23]
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like i need to study the Nimzo Indian before I play it again.</p>
<p>This already looks like an interesting result from an analytics exercise point of view. I am preparing new lines and noticing patterns in my openings which led to more loses. There is a scope to improve the script further, but I would like to focus now on using the script and improving my chess further.</p>
