<p>My career has been dynamic over the first few years. I have moved from project to project, within a company and across, up in hierarchy and sideways, creating a matrix of career options for myself. Sometimes the change was fast, at times slow and on some instances even in the wrong direction, but I have now built up a portfolio of experiences.</p>
