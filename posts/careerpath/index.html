<h1>The Type of roles I have come across</h1>

Jun. 11, 2021


<br/><br/>
<p>These are the various hats one can wear, (that I have come across) at a typical software company.</p>
<h2 id="programming">programming</h2>
<p>These people make sure the code matches the ideas and designs</p>
<h2 id="technical-lead">technical Lead</h2>
<p>These are the programmers who now also have a bunch of programmers to guide</p>
<h2 id="operations">operations</h2>
<p>These people handle the production environment and manage all day to day activities involved in running the software in live.</p>
<h2 id="devops">devops</h2>
<p>These people make the job of developers easier and systematic by introducing software to automate the various programming, release and deployment related processes</p>
<h2 id="implementation">implementation</h2>
<p>These people understand the scope of the product and shape it to meet the client needs. This person is required to interface a lot with other teams and the clients</p>
<h2 id="data-analytics">data analytics</h2>
<p>These people are there to measure the effectiveness of the solution and give inputs to finetune the solution</p>
<h2 id="architecturedesign">architecture/design</h2>
<p>These people figure out the overall technical design that matches the business needs. They can trade-off technicalities with practicality</p>
<h2 id="strategydepartment-heads">strategy/department heads</h2>
<p>These people review designs and products and make sure they are a good long term choice and fit it with what the rest of the company is doing, both in terms of product and technology stack. Work with people in similar roles throughout the company and makes sure everyone is headed in the same direction (e.g. if X is being deprecated make sure everyone is moving onto the same replacement)</p>
