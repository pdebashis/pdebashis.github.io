<p>These are the typical roles I have come across.</p>
<h2 id="programming">programming</h2>
<p>These people make sure the code matches the design and give feedback into the design process based on their technical knowledge</p>
<h2 id="architecturedesign">architecture/design</h2>
<p>These people figure out the overall technical design that matches the business needs, make tradeoffs between technical purity and practicality (e.g. X sucks but everyone in the company uses X so we have to use it too). This person is required to interface with other teams. They can typically mentor programmers.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<h2 id="strategydepartment-heads">strategy/department heads</h2>
<p>These people review designs and products and make sure they are a good long term choice and fit it with what the rest of the company is doing, both in terms of product and technology stack. Work with people in similar roles throughout the company and makes sure everyone is headed in the same direction (e.g. if X is being deprecated make sure everyone is moving onto the same replacement). Mentor architects/designers</p>
<h2 id="deveops">Deveops</h2>
