<h1>Yamaha FZ-S 2016</h1>

Nov. 29, 2024


<br/><br/>
<p>Owning a bike was a dream during college which became a reality within a year of leaving college. This bike was purchased on 16 Jan in 2017 and sold on 11 Nov 2024. The machine never dissapointed but when it was time to let it go, I let it go. While selling the bike, it had 30363 km on the odometer. Here is the odometer timeline and following that is a short chatGPT generated ode to the bike.</p>

<h1 id="poem">Poem</h1>
<p>Been ridin’ my Yamaha for six years strong<br>
Got it when I was young, but now I’m grown<br>
I was excited about my job, wanted to indulge<br>
Bought a bike when I could’ve walked, that’s the truth I won’t dodge</p>
<p>It’s reliable daily commute, and weekend fun<br>
From city streets to winding roads, it’s my number one</p>
<p>Yamaha FZ, from 2017, my ride or die<br>
From a young buck to a grown guy<br>
Style, confidence, and independence<br>
A coming of age, a life experience</p>
<p>It’s more than just a bike, it’s a state of mind<br>
Meditation and focus, physical and mental grind<br>
Accomplishment with every kilometer<br>
Feels like a sense of pride<br>
Memories to last a lifetime, an experience of a kind<br>
Though I drive the wheels these days, I can’t help but rewind<br>
Endless riding, nostalgia divine, cannot deny,<br>
Always by my side, my Yamaha Ride</p>
