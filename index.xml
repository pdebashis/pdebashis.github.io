      <description>We don&amp;rsquo;t really appreciate what we have until its gone. I was doing well and I got excited wanting to earn more money and experience new workplaces so I left. I expected any place i go to, to have the same standards and satisfaction of work.
Heck no. I joined a company out in an older part of bangalore that was a marketing analysis/telecom campaigning software company. I thought I was bringing some relevant/current knowledge in to the company that I had learned from other smart engineers I was fortunate to work with in the past.</description>

      <description>I meet some influencial people in my career every now and then. And by influencial I mean normal people who are working besides me and do the same same things as me but a little differently. In my first company on the 3rd year of my employment, my supervisor told me that he had assumed a managerial role since a long time but when he sees me working, he misses his days of coding and wanted to go back to a more technical role.</description>

      <description>A Hadoop ecosystem requires vigorous monitoring to identify any abnormality and prevent major downtimes. Major Hadoop service providers, provide their own tools for monitoring. But for a standalone hadoop, the monitoring aspect is an open field, and you can use your own tools and scripts to setup a monitoring framework.
Here, lets try to setup a basic script based monitoring capability with essential indicators
Uptime Monitoring Identify each process type running on each cluster.</description>

      <description>Testing Hugo Framework to setup a blog
Why blog? A lot of time is spent on technical work and their is no other outlet to put it out here on the internet.
Why Hugo? After working on rails for some time, I found the static generated sites (like Hugo) make more sense than having a full backend for a personal portfolio site. I do not have any dynamic content requirements and it was also easier to host.</description>
