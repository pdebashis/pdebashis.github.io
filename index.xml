      <description>A Hadoop ecosystem is a network of computers pooling its resources to solve larger problems. The ecosystem mainly consists of a filesystem and multiple individual components which sits atop the filesystem. Such an ecosystem definitely requires vigorous monitoring to identify any abnormality and prevent major downtimes. Major Hadoop service providers, provide their own tools for monitoring. But for a standalone hadoop, the monitoring aspect is an open field, and you can use your own tools and software.</description>

      <description>Testing Hugo Framework to setup a blog
Why blog? A lot of time is spent on technical work and their is no other outlet to put it out here on the internet.
Why Hugo? After working on rails for some time, I found the static generated sites (like Hugo) make more sense than having a full backend for a personal portfolio site. I do not have any dynamic content requirements and it was also easier to host.</description>
