      <description>Been ridin’ my Yamaha for six years strong
Got it when I was young, but now I’m grown
I was excited about my job, wanted to indulge
Bought a bike when I could’ve walked, that’s the truth I won’t dodge
It’s reliable daily commute, and weekend fun
From city streets to winding roads, it’s my number one
Yamaha FZ, from 2017, my ride or die
From a young buck to a grown guy</description>

      <title>Flavors of a Software Career</title>

      <description>My career has been dynamic over the first few years. I have moved from project to project, within a company and across, up in hierarchy and sideways, creating a matrix of career options for myself. Sometimes the change was fast, at times slow and on some instances even in the wrong direction, but I have now built up a portfolio of experiences.
These are the various hats I have witnessed and a toddler explanation of what each title entitles you to do typically.</description>

      <description>So, I had been trying to run a simple websocket listener. I had a system in place which will do the authentication and provide me with a wss:// address on which I can add a listener. There are a bunch of libraries to do this. So I copy pasted some code from the internet which used the ruby gems faye/websocket and EventMachine and all was good for a while. Till I decided to run this thing on a Windows machine.</description>

      <description>How the tech titans and their thinking machines could wrap humanity
Notable Qoutes This is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a whimper. - T.S.Eliot
The first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.
By not using any human data, Zero&amp;rsquo;s creators removed the constraints of human knowledge. Humans, as it turned out, would have held the system back. (in reference to the Alpha Zero)</description>

      <title>Competitive Programming memories from University</title>

      <description>Back in the day while starting with programming, there was little exposure to real world applications. Instead, all we used to do in college, is to use those programming skills for solving complex imaginary competetive programming questions.
NMPC was one such (NIST) Monthly Programming Contest. It was introduced in my third year at college and was organized only 3 times in 2 years even though the name indicated otherwise. The Sankalp coding contest on the other hand, was an yearly contest and was organized without fail.</description>

      <description>We don&amp;rsquo;t really appreciate what we have until its gone. I was having a good time in my first company and I expected any place i go to, to have the same standards and satisfaction of work.
Reality had something else to say. I joined a company out in an older part of bangalore that was a marketing analysis/telecom campaigning organisation. I was put into Customer support, where nobody gave any attention to work culture or work life balance.</description>

      <description>A Hadoop ecosystem requires vigorous monitoring to identify any abnormality and prevent major downtimes. Major Hadoop service providers, provide their own tools for monitoring. But for a standalone hadoop, the monitoring aspect is an open field, and you can use your own tools and scripts to setup a monitoring framework.
Here, lets try to setup a basic script based monitoring capability with essential indicators
Uptime Monitoring Identify each process type running on each cluster.</description>
